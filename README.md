Tuple Out!
A simple dice game for you and your friends.

The goal of the game is to roll the highest number with 3 dice.
You can re-roll the dice as many times as you would like to, however, if you get 2 dice with the same number, those two are locked and can't be re-rolled.
If you get all 3 dice with the same number, you lose!
