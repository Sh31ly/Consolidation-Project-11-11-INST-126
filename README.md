Tuple Out!
A simple dice game for you and your friends.

The goal of the game is to roll the highest number with 3 dice.
You can re-roll the dice as many times as you would like to, however, if you get 2 dice with the same number, those two are locked and can't be re-rolled. If you get all 3 dice with the same number, you get no points that round. You and your friends keep rotating until you reach the goal score of 50.
Your scores are tracked and saved, so after the game a fun little graph pops up showing everyones scores!

Ensure Python is installed/works on your device.
Ensure the packages pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib are installed correctly as well.

To start the game, execute the Main Game file, enter the number of players and imput the names, then you're ready to go!
